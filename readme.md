# BimAfrika

## Who we are

Bim Africa is a 3D digital collection of the rarest works crafted  in the african soil.

## why 

For a longtime, the expressions, values and ideas of the african people are quickly fading away
due to technology advancement and cultural fragmentation.

Coronavirus has accelerated the need for digitisation of the way of life.

The rise of the meta-verse world creates an opportunity to advance the african dream, spirit, 
aspiration and creativity into the global dimension.

In line with architectural modelling.

## visions

The collection aspires to bring out the creativity and ingenuity of African people way of life deeply embedded in 
their rare artwork back to life.

This will be captured  in 3d dimension and experience and sold as NFTS
